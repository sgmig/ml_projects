This directory contains a short notebook used for practicing the use of Tensorflow summaries and Tensorboard. 
The notebook is

    - tensorboard_example.ipynb

The idea is to train a linear model based on some made up data, and follow the evolution of the loss function and the parameters (slope and bias) as the training progresses. 

The logs generated are in the folder ./tensorboard_logs . Tensorboard can be started  by running
     
     tensorboard --logdir=./tensorboard_logs
     
     on a terminal, and accesing the url displayed after running the command.
