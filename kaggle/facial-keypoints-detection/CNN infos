# Pseudo log

The model saved in

./saved_models/keypoints_cnn_0

was trained for more than 1000 steps, using a dropout layer at the end, without any normalization on the images nor any batch normalization layer.

The cross validation error went down to ~40, where ~190 was the error using the mean positions from the training set. So although it's doing better than the mean, it is still not great. (We can see this by looking at the pictures produced). 

In a similar setup but without using the dropout layer I got the cv and train errors down to arund ~10, but it was also not enough. It seemed to predict close to the mean position for most faces. 

I am going to build a different model implementing normalization.
