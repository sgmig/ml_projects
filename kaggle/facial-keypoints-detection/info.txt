This folder contains two Jupyter notebooks built for the Kaggle Facial Keypoints Recognition challenge. 

The data can be downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/overview.

In order to run the code, the data files training.csv, test.csv and IdLookupTable.csv should be copied on this directory.

This directory is organized as follows:

     - facial_keypoints_intro.ipynb: A notebook for the initial exploration of the data. Contains visualizations of the images and keypoints.

     - facial_keypoints_CNN.ipynb: Notebook for building and training a Convolutional Neural Network for the task of facial keypoint recognition, and drawing predictions from this network. 
     Each model generated will be saved in a folder model_x, where x is a number. Within the model folder there is a logs/ folder, containing logs for Tensorboard. Tensorboard can be started  by running
     
     tensorboard --logdir=./model_x/logs
     
     on a terminal, and accesing the url displayed after running the command. 

     - The folder model_1 contains the files and logs for loading an already trained version of the CNN. The tensorboard logs can be accessed as explained before. This folder contains a submission file, submission_model_1.csv, which scores a RMSE of 
     
     RMSE = 2.24962  
     
     on the Kaggle website, corresponding to place 50th in the private leaderboard. 
     
     The graph of the network can be accesesd via the tensorboard logs, as well as a summary of the hyperparameters used. For practicality, the same summary is included here:
